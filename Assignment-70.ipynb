It encompasses several issues, and understanding these challenges is crucial because they impact the performance, efficiency, and interpretability of machine learning models. Here's an overview of the curse of dimensionality and its importance:\n",

    "* #### Increased Computational Complexity: \n",
    "In high-dimensional spaces, algorithms that depend on distance calculations, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and clustering, become computationally expensive. As the number of dimensions increases, the number of data points needed to maintain the same data density also increases exponentially. This leads to longer training and prediction times.\n",
